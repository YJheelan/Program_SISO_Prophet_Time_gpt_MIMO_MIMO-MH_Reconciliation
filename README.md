# Multi-Source Energy Forecasting with Optimal Reconciliation via Multi-Input Multi-Output Multi-Horizon (MIMO-MH) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
## Overview
The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources poses several challenges, particularly regarding reliability, energy quality, and supply-demand balance [[1]](#ref1). In this context, forecasting electricity production from renewable sources such as wind and solar energy becomes essential for the efficient and continuous operation of the electrical grid [[2]](#ref2).

The Multi-Input Multi-Output Multi-Horizon (MIMO-MH) approach with reconciliation and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) enables synchronization of forecasts from different sources (solar, thermal, hydraulic, imports, etc.) to ensure consistency with net consumption (equivalent to grid demand), while capturing global physical interactions and constraints (supply-demand balance, import/export, self-consumption) [[3]](#ref3).

Unlike Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) models, which process each source independently, MIMO leverages correlations between sources and shared variability, thereby improving aggregate accuracy and reducing total deviations (through the compensatory effect between errors). In parallel, ELM offers fast learning, an analytical closed-form solution, and low computational load, making it ideal for near real-time adaptation. This approach optimizes the forecasting of final demand (net consumption), which is essential for dispatching, import management, and grid stability, while providing a robust and cost-effective solution for highly variable, self-consumption-prone multi-energy systems.

## Dataset Description

The performance of energy forecasting models directly depends on the quality and representativeness of the data. To capture the dynamics of interactions between various energy sources, we use detailed hourly time series over a sufficiently long period to reflect actual variability. A time series is a sequence of observations indexed by time. In this report, the time series represent the hourly electricity production in MWh from different sources (Thermal, Hydropower, Micro-hydro, Solar PV, Wind, Bioenergy, Imports). They also include the average production cost in â‚¬/MWh and the total production in MWh. These series are managed by EDF for the Corsica region (https://opendata-corse.edf.fr/pages/home0/), covering the period from 2016 to 2022 with hourly resolution, ensuring both reliability and representativeness of the Corsican island energy context.

Column names in the processed data :
- `total_production_mw`: Total electricity production.
- `thermal_mw`: Thermal energy production.
- `hydraulic_mw`: Hydraulic energy production.
- `micro_hydraulic_mw`: Micro-hydraulic energy production.
- `solar_photovoltaic_mw`: Solar photovoltaic energy production.
- `wind_mw`: Wind energy production.
- `bioenergy_mw`: Bioenergy production.
- `imports_mw`: Imported energy.

## Methodology

### 1. Single Input Single Output (SISO)
Based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM): a single hidden layer neural network with very fast learning and low computational cost, suitable for near real-time forecasting.
Forecasts a single energy source for a given horizon independently.
Provides good accuracy but remains limited in scope and slower when scaling to multiple sources and horizons.

### 2. Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO)
Jointly forecasts all energy sources for a given horizon.
Exploits cross-source correlations and shared variability patterns to improve robustness and overall aggregate performance.
Extends beyond SISO by integrating interdependencies between sources

### 3. Multi-Horizon Extension (MIMO-MH)
Generalizes MIMO to predict all sources across multiple horizons simultaneously within a single model.
Increases efficiency and ensures temporal consistency across forecasts.
Followed by an optimal reconciliation step, ensuring that the sum of individual source forecasts always matches the expected system-level total at each horizon.

### 4. Hierarchical Forecast Reconciliation
Applies the Minimum Trace (MinT) reconciliation method with Weighted Least Squares (WLS).
Ensures that the sum of disaggregated forecasts (e.g., by source) always matches the corresponding aggregate totals at each horizon.
Minimizes the overall forecast error variance, improving coherence, accuracy, and consistency across all hierarchical levels.

### 5. Benchmarking Methods
- **ELM Variants**: Base and reconciled (REC) versions of SISO, MIMO, MIMO-MH.
- **External Models**: Prophet (probabilistic univariate) and TimeGPT (pre-trained foundation model).
- **Persistence Models**: Simple baselines using historical values (last value at horizon or 24h back). Implemented in `models.py` as `run_persistence_models`.
